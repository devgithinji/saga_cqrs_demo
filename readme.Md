# E-commerce microservices demo 

## showcasing usage of:

### CQRS(Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

It is an architectural pattern that separates the read and write operations (queries and commands) of an application into separate parts.

### Saga

a distributed system design pattern used to manage long-lived transactions and ensure data consistency across multiple microservices. 

(Used the Orchestration based saga)

### Axon framework

The Axon Framework is a Java-based framework that provides tools and components for building scalable and event-driven applications based on the CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and Event Sourcing patterns. It simplifies the development of complex distributed systems by providing abstractions for managing events, commands, aggregates, and event sourcing.
